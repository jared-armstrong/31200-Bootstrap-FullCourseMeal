# 5 Course Meal by Bootstrap: Jared Armstrong

For this assignment, I used multiple different Bootstrap classes to add more responsivness and functionality to my web page. 
I started off with a basic header that uses the 'container-fluid' class so it extends across the whole width of the web page
at all times. The header is responsive when the window gets resized and has a fixed position when scrolling down. In addition,
I used a div with a class name of 'container text-center' so everything in the container would be displayed in the center of 
the web page. Within this container, I had two divs with the class of 'row' to serve as my two rows for this assignment. Within
one row, I used three classes of class 'col' for my columns and used two classes of class 'col' in the second row for the
display of my elements. In the second row, I used class 'col-4' to make the display of the second row a little more clean and 
to position the column in line with the last element of the first row. Lastly, as you can see on the page, there are some
nice cards with the images for the food within the full course meal as well as a title for the food and a description with a 
summarized recipe. For the cards, I used Bootstrap's class of 'card' while incorporating four other classes: 'card-img-top', 
'card-body', 'card-title', and 'card-text'. With the use of all of these Boostrap classes I was able to create a responsive
web page with a nice layout and cool design features!
